We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.<br/>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.

New Zealand is on the ‘approved list’. If a country is on this approved list, then data controllers may transfer personal data to such countries, in the same way as if the transfer were being made within the EEA.<br/>
<br></p>

<h4><strong>5. Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</strong></h4>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.<br/>
<br></p>

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.<br/>
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.<br/>
